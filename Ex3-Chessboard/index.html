	<h1>Exercise 3: Chessboard</h1>
	<h2>Eloquent JavaScript</h2>

	<p>Write a program that creates a string that represents an 8Ã—8 grid, using newline characters to separate lines. At each position of the grid there is either a space or a "#" character. The characters should form a chessboard.</p>
	<p>Passing this string to console.log should show something like this:</p>

	<pre> # # # #
# # # # 
 # # # #
# # # # 
 # # # #
# # # # 
 # # # #
# # # #</pre>

	<p>When you have a program that generates this pattern, define a binding size = 8 and change the program so that it works for any size, outputting a grid of the given width and height.</p>
	<p><em>Open the console to see the result</em></p>
