	<h1>Exercise 2: FizzBuzz</h1>
	<h2>Eloquent JavaScript</h2>
	<p>Write a program that uses console.log to print all the numbers from 1 to 100, with two exceptions. For numbers divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for numbers divisible by 5 (and not 3), print "Buzz" instead.</p>
	<p>When you have that working, modify your program to print "FizzBuzz" for numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5 (and still print "Fizz" or "Buzz" for numbers divisible by only one of those).</p>
	<p>(This is actually an interview question that has been claimed to weed out a significant percentage of programmer candidates. So if you solved it, your labor market value just went up.)</p>
	<p><em>Open the console to see the result</em></p>
